# Just a Bunch of Sprites

I am currently practicing how to draw in pixel art, and I figured that I might as well share what I have made so far.

So here it is, this is just a bunch of spritesâ€‹ I made on my free time, don't expect too much of it and I will probably change or remove a lot of them if I feel like it.

You'll see here both ``.aseprite`` and ``.png`` files.

On a side note. since I'm lazy I usually draw a autotile in RPGMaker MV format since they are easier, and use a ![script](https://github.com/leonarJorge/gamedev-aseprite-scripts) I made in Aseprite to convert it into a Godot compatible format so you'll see both formats in this pack.
